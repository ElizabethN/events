## What we learned:
- Both hosts cannot work
  - At least one host should be available to work directly with participants
  - At least one host should be focused on managing the event (making sure everyone knows where everything is, coordinating with catering, MCing the day, answering questions, getting things for people when needed, answering questions, etc)
- In the events repo have a resources directory with the slide templates, etc prepared
- Make sure we know what issues we want to address at that event, and go over those issues with the host
- Have a lead architect available (remotely if necessary)
- Make sure to test dev setup before hand with a blank machine to avoid any unexpected obstacles (like the script issue we faced when upgrading from Couch 1.9 to 2.0)
- If we are offering food we should make sure to ask about any special eating requirements in the sign up form so we can accommodate everyone
- make sure coffee is available in large quantities
- The Ember primer at the beginning is critical for new contributors.
