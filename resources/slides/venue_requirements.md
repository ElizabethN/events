### Venue Requirements

Good places to start include coode schools and coworking spaces. Libraries and unique spaces are also worth researching. Check Meetup.com for locations of local tech events; these companies and spaces would likely be open to hosting something.

These are our basic needs for an event. We estimate about 20 people in attendance.

- Tables and chairs for everyone to have a space to hack
- Wifi that can take a bit of a beating
- Outlets for power adapters
- AV equipment, such as a mic and projector
- Availability all day Friday and Saturday (flexible)
- A refrigerator or access to coolers for chilling drinks
- Ability to bring in food and drinks (or some way to cater the event with light snacks)
- Wheelchair accessibility
- Public access is ok

We also want to find out:
- Is it ok that the event is open to the public?
- Are there any locked doors or security measures attendees will have to go through to get there?
- What's the parking situation?
- Will we be able to get the wifi password and codes for restrooms?
- Are there gender-neutral bathrooms available?

Other research before nailing down a date with the venue:
- Are there any major events happening nearby? Sporting events, concerts, anything else that would make parking and/or traveling to the event a major hassle.
- Are there other tech events happening that weekend that might pull people away?
